**LibertyBot**: LibertyBot is a community service project created by Theodore Gercken for libertarian discord servers. It is privacy focused, requiring no perms or data storing. It is the ultimate LP application with features to tie the libertarian internet community together on Discord.

Use the prefix "-" before any commands. (ex: "-events" for events).

Invite LibertyBot through the bot website:

Making LibertyBot available to everyone 24/7 costs $8 a month, so if you want to help out to make sure it keeps existing, feel free to donate to the patreon. Any money in excess of what is needed to host LibertyBot will be donated to the Libertarian Youth Caucus or the Frontier Project.
